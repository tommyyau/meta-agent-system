# Product Requirements Document
## Meta-Agent System: Adaptive Agent Generator for Idea-to-Wireframes

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 9 June 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  
**Status:** First Draft  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Entrepreneurs and product builders face a critical bottleneck when translating business ideas into actionable prototypes. The core issue is that **quality outputs require specific inputs, but users express information in vastly different languages, terminologies, and frameworks** based on their background, industry, and sophistication level.

Static AI agents cannot adapt to the infinite variety of user expression patterns:
- A fintech founder speaks differently than a healthcare entrepreneur
- Technical founders use different terminology than business-focused founders
- Solo entrepreneurs have different context than startup teams

### 1.2 Solution Vision
Create a **meta-agent system** that analyzes incoming user characteristics and **dynamically generates specialized sub-agents** perfectly calibrated to extract required information from specific user types. The system includes **intelligent escape hatches** that generate domain-specific assumptions to maintain momentum while documenting all assumptions for user review and refinement.

### 1.3 Key Success Metrics
- **User Completion Rate:** 85%+ of users complete the idea-to-wireframe journey
- **Time to First Wireframe:** <15 minutes average
- **Assumption Accuracy:** 80%+ of generated assumptions accepted by users
- **Output Quality:** Assumption-based outputs match 90% quality of fully-questioned outputs
