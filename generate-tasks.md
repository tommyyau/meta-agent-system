# Task Generation Document
## Meta-Agent System: Development Tasks & Implementation Plan

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 10Thank you.  June 2025  
**Based on:** Meta-Agent System PRD v1.0  
**Status:** Development Ready  

---

## 0. COURSE CORRECTION: From Static to Dynamic Conversation (10 June 2024)

### 0.1 Critical Learning & Pivot

**What We Initially Built Wrong:**
- ❌ Static question banks with 50+ pre-written questions per domain
- ❌ Database-driven question storage and retrieval
- ❌ Stage-based filtering of predetermined questions
- ❌ Separate systems for questioning, escape detection, and assumption generation

**What We Learned:**
The original vision was always about **dynamic, adaptive conversation** that responds to user sophistication and engagement in real-time. Building static question banks completely missed the point of intelligent, contextual interaction.

**Course Correction Applied:**
- ✅ **TASK-005:** Completely rewritten from "Question Banks" to "Dynamic Conversation Engine"
- ✅ **TASK-006:** Integrated escape detection into conversation flow (no separate system)
- ✅ **TASK-007:** Context-aware assumption generation based on conversation history
- ✅ **TASK-008D:** Domain expertise through LLM prompts, not static content

**New Core Architecture:**
```
User Input → LLM Analysis → Dynamic Question Generation → Context Update
     ↓
Sophistication Assessment + Escape Detection + Domain Expertise
     ↓
Next Question OR Assumption Generation (seamless pivot)
```

**Key Insight:** The system should feel like talking to a domain expert who adapts their questioning style based on your responses, not like filling out a survey.

### 0.2 Implementation Status & Next Steps

**Files Created During Wrong Approach (Static Question Banks):**
- ✅ `lib/data/fintech-questions.ts` - 35 manually written fintech questions
- ✅ `lib/data/healthcare-questions.ts` - 16 LLM-generated healthcare questions  
- ✅ `scripts/generate-healthcare-questions-simple.js` - LLM question generator
- ✅ `app/api/questions/fintech/test/route.ts` - Fintech question testing API
- ✅ `app/api/questions/healthcare/test/route.ts` - Healthcare question testing API

**What These Files Taught Us:**
- LLM-generated questions have superior domain expertise vs manual writing
- Dynamic generation is faster and more scalable than static banks
- Question quality analysis showed GPT-4 produces expert-level domain knowledge

**Next Implementation Priority:**
1. **Build TASK-005: Dynamic Conversation Engine** using lessons learned from LLM question generation
2. **Integrate escape detection and assumption generation** into single conversation flow
3. **Use domain expertise prompts** instead of static question databases
4. **Test dynamic conversation** with real users to validate adaptive questioning

**Recommended Approach:**
Keep the test APIs and generated questions as **reference examples** for conversation quality, but build the actual system using dynamic LLM conversation as outlined in the updated TASK-005.

## 0. CRITICAL REVIEW: Task Plan vs PRD Vision Analysis

### 0.1 PRD Vision Gap Analysis

After comprehensive review of the PRD, several **critical gaps** have been identified in the current task plan that must be addressed to deliver the sophisticated meta-agent system vision:

#### **MAJOR GAPS IDENTIFIED:**

### 0.2 Missing Core Features

#### **GAP 1: Conversation Stage Management System**
**PRD Requirement:** 4-stage conversation flow (Idea Clarity → User Workflow → Technical Specs → Wireframes)
**Current Status:** Basic conversation flow mentioned but not systematically designed
**Impact:** Core user experience architecture missing

#### **GAP 2: Sophisticated Profile Detection (95% accuracy target)**
**PRD Requirement:** Advanced NLP with industry classification, role detection, sophistication scoring
**Current Status:** Basic profile detection planned at 70% accuracy
**Impact:** Insufficient for dynamic agent generation quality

#### **GAP 3: Advanced Assumption Cascade System**
**PRD Requirement:** When assumptions change, all affected deliverables auto-update with dependency tracking
**Current Status:** Not planned in current tasks
**Impact:** Core value proposition of transparent assumption system incomplete

#### **GAP 4: Multi-Domain Agent Architecture (5-7 domains in Phase 2)**
**PRD Requirement:** Fintech, Healthcare, E-commerce, SaaS, Consumer Apps, Enterprise Software
**Current Status:** Only 3 domains planned (fintech, healthcare, general)
**Impact:** Insufficient market coverage for target user base

#### **GAP 5: Professional Wireframe Quality**
**PRD Requirement:** "Indistinguishable from professional design" with interactive elements
**Current Status:** "Basic wireframe generator" planned
**Impact:** Output quality won't meet user expectations for investor presentations

#### **GAP 6: Real-time Analytics & Learning System**
**PRD Requirement:** Continuous improvement of assumption accuracy through user feedback
**Current Status:** Basic analytics planned, no learning system
**Impact:** System won't improve over time, competitive disadvantage

**Expert User Response:** "I'm building a regulatory reporting solution for mid-market banks"
→ **Generated Question:** "Which specific compliance frameworks are you targeting - SOC2, PCI DSS, or regulatory reporting like BSA/AML?"

**Impatient User:** "This is taking too long, just show me something"
→ **System Response:** "I understand! Let me generate smart assumptions based on what you've told me..."

**Technical Implementation:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 conversation analysis with custom prompts per domain
