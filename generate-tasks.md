## 0. CRITICAL REVIEW: Task Plan vs PRD Vision Analysis

### 0.1 PRD Vision Gap Analysis

After comprehensive review of the PRD, several **critical gaps** have been identified in the current task plan that must be addressed to deliver the sophisticated meta-agent system vision:

#### **MAJOR GAPS IDENTIFIED:**

### 0.2 Missing Core Features

#### **GAP 1: Conversation Stage Management System**
**PRD Requirement:** 4-stage conversation flow (Idea Clarity → User Workflow → Technical Specs → Wireframes)
**Current Status:** Basic conversation flow mentioned but not systematically designed
**Impact:** Core user experience architecture missing

#### **GAP 2: Sophisticated Profile Detection (95% accuracy target)**
**PRD Requirement:** Advanced NLP with industry classification, role detection, sophistication scoring
**Current Status:** Basic profile detection planned at 70% accuracy
**Impact:** Insufficient for dynamic agent generation quality

#### **GAP 3: Advanced Assumption Cascade System**
**PRD Requirement:** When assumptions change, all affected deliverables auto-update with dependency tracking
**Current Status:** Not planned in current tasks
**Impact:** Core value proposition of transparent assumption system incomplete

#### **GAP 4: Multi-Domain Agent Architecture (5-7 domains in Phase 2)**
**PRD Requirement:** Fintech, Healthcare, E-commerce, SaaS, Consumer Apps, Enterprise Software
**Current Status:** Only 3 domains planned (fintech, healthcare, general)
**Impact:** Insufficient market coverage for target user base

#### **GAP 5: Professional Wireframe Quality**
**PRD Requirement:** "Indistinguishable from professional design" with interactive elements
**Current Status:** "Basic wireframe generator" planned
**Impact:** Output quality won't meet user expectations for investor presentations

#### **GAP 6: Real-time Analytics & Learning System**
**PRD Requirement:** Continuous improvement of assumption accuracy through user feedback
**Current Status:** Basic analytics planned, no learning system
**Impact:** System won't improve over time, competitive disadvantage
