## üéâ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: GPT-4 Powered Conversation Orchestrator**

We have successfully implemented the **heart of our meta-agent system** - a dynamic conversation engine that replaces static question banks with intelligent, adaptive conversations powered by GPT-4.

### üî• **What Makes This Revolutionary**

**‚ùå OLD APPROACH (What We Avoided):**
- Static question banks with 50+ pre-written questions
- Database-driven question storage and retrieval  
- Stage-based filtering of predetermined questions
- Separate systems for questioning, escape detection, and assumption generation

**‚úÖ NEW APPROACH (What We Built):**
- **Dynamic GPT-4 Question Generation** - Every question tailored to user context
- **Real-time Sophistication Assessment** - Adapts questioning complexity on the fly
- **Domain Expertise Integration** - Demonstrates actual industry knowledge
- **Escape Signal Detection** - Recognizes boredom/impatience and pivots smoothly
- **Context Preservation** - Builds conversation history and learns from each exchange
